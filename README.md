# Project Title: Automation testing of the rest API of Dmoney,a sample finance website, using REST Assured and TestNG

## Project Summary: For this project, I have automated a flow that allows the admin to log in, add new users, and carry out various CRUD operations for the users. Money has been deposited into each agent's account by a unique kind of agent known as SYSTEM.Agents have the ability to deposit and withdraw money from customers as well as pay merchants.Customers are able to send and receive money as well as pay merchants for various services.Users of any kind can view their own statement and balance.
In this project I have used  **properties.config** file to store  **baseURL** and **partner key**
and created a json file(users.json) to store and fetch users information to use these in the tests written in APITestRunner.java.
